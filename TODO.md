# TODO list #

Notes for some things to be changed before a beta release:

 - verify: Gentoo kernel reports to be compiled with GCC 5.4.0 but GCC 6.4.0 was installed
 - Since kernel 4.16.0 the virtualbox kernel module was activated (should be tested at least for shared folders)
 - otherwise we want to have shared folders etc, therefor install virtualbox guest additions?
 - since v0.0.4:
   - gentoo-sources and debian-sources are mixed, we just want the gentoo-sources, remove debian-sources (eclean-kernel?)
   - kernel sources could possibly be cleaned or better removed completely to save a lot of space
